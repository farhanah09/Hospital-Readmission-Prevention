# Hospital-Readmission-Prevention
This GitHub repository contains the code for an algorithm developed to lower hospital readmission rates by implementing a telehealth system for the right patients. The algorithm aims to provide remote healthcare services to patients, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the algorithm is designed to save costs for the hospital by optimizing resource allocation and prioritizing high-risk patients for telehealth interventions.
This project was initially developed as part of the Big Data (45980) course at CMU Tepper, where the focus was on leveraging large-scale data analytics techniques to address healthcare challenges. The dataset used in this project was obtained from https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/781670. The dataset includes relevant patient information, medical histories, and readmission records, enabling the algorithm to identify patterns and predict readmission risks.

The code in this repository implements various machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify patients who would benefit from telehealth services. It includes preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation scripts. The repository also provides documentation, instructions, and examples to facilitate understanding and usage of the algorithm.
